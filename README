# PINGTOWN

Crazy idea of a distributable ping checkier: 

POST /check?target=..&interval=1&failure_after=3&webhook=...
... or something like that. 
will fire off the callback when target fails to return 20X responses.

Also learning clojure.

## Usage

	lein deps (the first time !)
	lein ring server

This will start the app - and open a browser. Hack away. 
Then go to https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/user/keys and get your credentials - punch them in (see project.clj). 
You don't need to install anything else (deps will pull down the cloudbees plugin - you can of course install it yourself if you want).

When finished: 
	
	lein cloudbees deploy
	lein cloudbees list-apps
	lein cloudbees

Be happy.
